# 📝 Seattle Crime Dashboard - 🚧 *Currently in Progress!*  
📊 **Analyzing and Predicting Crime Trends in Seattle (2008 - February 4th, 2020)**  

## 📍 Overview  

Over the past few years, crime has risen sharply in Seattle, with homicides increasing more than 75% in the past five years and significant increases in assaults, robberies, and property crime. This rise in criminal activity created alarm about public safety, law enforcement practices, and crime prevention strategies.  

I created the Seattle Crime Data Dashboard as a tool to visualize and analyze crime trends, placing real data in the hands of citizens, researchers, and policy makers to be interpreted and accessed. With data-driven analysis, we can identify trends, hotspots, and emerging threats, allowing decision-making to be more intelligent in fighting crime.  

The dashboard itself manages over 1.1 million crime reports, allowing the filtering, investigation, and visualization of crime patterns all around Seattle.  

I hope that this tool can bridge the gap between raw data and useful information, delivering interactive analytics, crime mapping, and future projections to support crime prevention and public safety.
